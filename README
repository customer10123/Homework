!!!IMPORTANT!!! Script should be run as a superuser

This is a script with the following requirements:

Create a shell script which will represent an automated test
You should use beakerlib as your testing library
You should be able to execute the script from the Linux terminal
Script should check that it is running on Fedora 30 
Try to verify this in two separate ways
In script setup make sure the lorax-composer package is installed
Script should verify if the /var/lib/lorax/composer directory exists
Script should create a new user called “jenkins”
Script should verify the user “jenkins” exists
Script should create a temporary file containing “Hello World”
Script should clean up after itself

NOTES:
Since I never used bakerlib before I was mainly inspired by the manual page https://www.mankier.com/1/beakerlib#
Not sure if user jenkins should be also deleted as part of cleanup. If so it could be done simpy by 'userdel jenkins'
The temporary file is created in the temporary directory so I suppose it should be considered as temporary since the folder is deleted during cleanup. Otherwise it could just be created using mktemp comman.
Not sure if the last line is needed but it prints the report in a readable format for assessment.
